## Language Learning Application
Dayanna Garcia, Spring 2023

### Abstract

[Comment_2]: <> (An example of a reference in paper text, cite in Reference list -- see Comment 8)
In this paper I will be discussing the importance of language and of communicating through different languages, as well as the benefits of learning a new language. This paper will outline a mobile application that helps people learn a new language, which is something I will one day like to manage. The goal of this paper is to deliver and explain a mobile application that can help people learn a new language. I will apply the learning I gained through lecture and discussion from the course IS340 Product Management to incorporate it into this project.
