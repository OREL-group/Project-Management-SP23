Dayanna Garcia, Spring 2023

### Abstract

[Comment_2]: <> (An example of a reference in paper text, cite in Reference list -- see Comment 8)
In this paper I will be discussing the importance of language and of communicating through different languages, as well as the benefits of learning a new language. This paper will outline a mobile application that helps people learn a new language, which is something I will one day like to manage. The goal of this paper is to deliver and explain a mobile application that can help people learn a new language. I will apply the learning I gained through lecture and discussion from the course IS340 Product Management to incorporate it into this project.


### Purpose

[Comment_3]: <> (begin your text here)
The purpose of this mobile application is to essentially help people all around the globe learn a new language. Language in general is important to express our thoughts, feelings and ideas and allows us to share them with others. It also helps us connect with one another and understand our different cultures and communities. Communicating through different languages helps us also gain a better understanding of a person’s customs and beliefs. Being able to communicate in various languages is a good skill to have since it can be useful in a business setting. Also, when a person is traveling to different countries, there are going to be other languages being spoken there so it will be beneficial to speak the language of a country to get around and have a better and positive experience. Overall, learning a new language can be very self rewarding and a great experience, it can help us learn more about ourselves and others. This application will provide an accessible and engaging tool for people who want to learn a new language. The app would aim to make language learning more convenient, interactive, and effective by offering a variety of features and resources that support different learning styles and levels

The mobile application I will be managing will include features like vocabulary lists. This will be important to have because having a strong vocabulary is essential for effective communication. The more words a user knows, then the easier it is to express their ideas, convey information, and understand what others are saying. Also, if there is a specific area a user wants to focus on then vocabulary lists can be used to study  with the interest area. For example, if a user wants to focus on learning words to prepare themselves to go to the beach, then they will study words that apply to that. A great use of these lists will be to track progress in language and how much users have learned over time. 
Another feature it will include, are grammar rules, this will provide a structure and a set of guidelines that help learners to communicate effectively and accurately. This will be important to ensure that proper grammar is being used to convey messages clearly as well as remain professional and have that image. Pronunciation exercises too will be available to users. This will be helpful in allowing users to produce the correct sounds of the languages for effective communication. This will also be very crucial for user’s who are trying to learn a language that is very different from their own native language. 
It will also incorporate a chatbot that allows users to practice conversational skills with an Artificial Intelligence virtual partner. This will allow users to practice with someone anytime and anywhere, and not face any judgment or feel embarrassed and instead receive constructive feedback. An AI partner will simulate a real life conversation and it will feel like speaking to a real person so it will be more natural and smooth.
This project is intended to be developed collaboratively and encourage community involvement, specifically for individuals who share a passion for language learning.


### Target Audience

[Comment_4]: <> (begin your text here)
The target audience would be anyone who is interested in learning a new language, regardless of their age, level of proficiency, or background. The app could be useful for individuals who are self-motivated and prefer to have flexibility and learn at their own pace and schedule. With having this app downloaded on a mobile device, it can allow users to access language learning materials and practice exercises anytime, anywhere, using their mobile device. 
Furthermore, this app would also be beneficial for users who do not have access to traditional language learning resources like schools, classrooms, or tutors. This can be a substitute for these resources and give users additional practice and support.


### Project Scope

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text two spaces after the last underscore in the previous line)
The scope of the app would involve designing, developing, and releasing a functional and user-friendly mobile app that supports language learning. The project would involve creating a wide range of features and resources that support different learning styles and levels, like I mentioned before  vocabulary lists, grammar rules, pronunciation exercises, and  practice through a chatbot.It would also involve making the source code available to the public under an open-source license, which would allow other developers to contribute to the app's improvement and evolution over time. 
A license I would implement is an MIT License, this is a popular open-source software license that is permissive and widely recognized. 
The project scope would include documentation, testing, and quality assurance to ensure that the app is reliable, secure, and accessible to a wide audience. It will also involve building a community around the app, promoting it, and seeking feedback from users and contributors to further improve and develop the app.


### Why Use Open Source

[Comment 6]: <> (begin your text two spaces after the last underscore in the previous line)
Firstly, open-source mobile app development tools are often free or have a low cost compared to proprietary software. This allows developers to save on licensing fees and invest more in app development.
Secondly, open-source mobile app development tools offer greater flexibility and customizability compared to proprietary software. Developers can modify the source code to suit their specific needs, integrate third-party libraries, and add features and functionalities that are not available in proprietary software.
Thirdly, open-source mobile app development tools have a large community of developers who contribute to the development and improvement of the software. This community-driven approach results in faster bug fixes, updates, and enhancements, which means that open-source mobile apps are often more stable, reliable, and secure.
Finally, using open-source mobile app development tools promotes transparency, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Developers can learn from each other, share best practices, and build on each other's work, resulting in higher quality apps that benefit everyone.
Overall, using open-source mobile app development tools is a cost-effective, flexible, and collaborative approach to building mobile apps that can lead to high-quality, stable, and reliable software.


### Potential Downsides 

[Comment_7]: <> (begin your text two spaces after the last underscore in the previous line)
Some of the potential downsides to this language learning mobile is that it may hinder communication skills with real people in actual situations. Although this app has a virtual artificial intelligence chat box and other exercises that are great practice, it does not equal the same human interactions and conversational skills one would have. 
Also, since this is a mobile application, it is accessible and available with any technologies anytime and anywhere. Because of this, it might make users depend on technology more than they were and rely on technology to learn any material. This is a potential issue because technology will not always be available for people to use and there could also be glitches that can occur with this application, which will prevent users from progressing in their learning. One last potential downside is that this application and learning style does not fit everyone’s preferred learning and is not a one-size fits all. Some users might need more personalized instruction, exercises or other approaches to be able to learn a new language. 


### License 

[Comment_8]: <> (begin your text two spaces after the last underscore in the previous line)
I will use an MIT License for this mobile app. The MIT License is a permissive open source software license. This will allow users to use and modify the app and make changes to better it. As I have previously mentioned, this app will mostly be run by a community of people who share a love and passion for language learning. Any changes and modifications to the app will be looked over and approved. This license is widely known and popular for mobile application development. The MIT license is simple to understand, so it will be easier for users to collaborate on this and to implement any features. This will allow more flexibility for the development process. 

### Project Expansions

[Comment_9]: <> (begin your text two spaces after the last underscore in the previous line)
Once this application has enough users, possible features that I see that could be implemented is a buddy pen pal system. With users from all over the world, this will be very helpful for users to improve and practice their skills. Pen pals could be matched up depending on their language level. Users could also be paired up with a native speaker of the language they are trying to learn and get practice in. With a native speaker, users will learn the correct pronunciation and vocabulary directly from them. Also, this can expose users to also learn slang from different countries. The mobile app can teach users the formal language, but not slang. This can help users communicate more effectively with native speakers of that language, and for users to understand non-formal comments, such as jokes. Lastly, this pen pal system can start friendships. This system does not just have to be for language practice but to also make connections and to learn about other people's cultures.



### Conclusion      

[Comment_10]: <> (begin your text here)
In conclusion, language itself is very important in people’s everyday life. Communicating in one’s language allows one to express themselves fully since it is what they know best and are most comfortable with. Language is tied to culture as well as identity. Therefore, language makes up who you are. 
My desire to manage a project like this stems from my personal value of upholding both language and culture. I myself am proud of the languages I speak and the culture I am part of and I believe everyone should be proud of the native language they speak and the fact that they are even able to speak it. I also believe that we as a society should encourage others to learn at least one new language so that they become bilingual or trilingual and are aware and explore the other cultures that exist. There are benefits to being able to communicate effectively in multiple languages apart from being culturally aware. One of which includes increased career opportunities. People who speak more than one language are seen as competitive in their field since they are able to communicate with a wide range of people.A language learning mobile application will allow people regardless of age, background, and proficiency level of languages to achieve this. 
I am aware there are other applications similar to the one I want to manage, but I have yet to know of one that is supported by Artificial Intelligence and by a community of people that are passionate about it. I believe if there ever comes a time where an application like this is actually developed, it will become very successful and really help people. 
This application will overall allow people to learn about others and themselves.
